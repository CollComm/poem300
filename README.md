# ShiJing2Python
## Project Description
ShiJing2Python is an ambitious open-source project that seeks to translate the 诗经 (Classic of Poetry, also known as the Book of Songs), one of the oldest and most revered collections of Chinese poetry, into Python code.

## Background
The 诗经 is an anthology of 305 Chinese poems, dating back to the 11th to 7th centuries BC. It is considered one of the "Five Classics" of Chinese literature. These poems serve as a window into early Chinese culture, their life, religious rituals, customs, and expressions of love, struggle, and more.

## Objective
This project aims to translate these ancient Chinese poems into Python code in a meaningful way, integrating computational creativity into traditional literature. The goal isn't just to create a literal translation into Python code, but rather to code structures, functions, and classes that reflect the themes, structure, and rhythm of the original text in an abstract yet recognizable manner. We seek to find a harmonic balance between the rigid, logical structure of code and the fluid, emotive nuances of poetry.

## Functionality
By rendering the 诗经 as Python code, we hope to allow users to interact with the poems in a unique, dynamic way. Users may 'execute' a poem and receive different outputs depending on various factors, like their system time, input parameters, etc. This project can serve as an educational tool for those learning Python programming or Chinese literature, and more broadly, as an exploration of the intersection between humanities and computer science.

## Collaboration
We welcome and appreciate any contribution, whether that be coding, providing translations, sharing ideas, or offering feedback. To contribute, please fork the repository, make your changes, and create a pull request. We also appreciate bug reports, suggestions, and other feedback.

## Disclaimers
This project aims to respect and honor the original work. It does not claim to improve upon or replace the experience of reading the original text, but instead offers a new perspective and a modern, interactive approach to experiencing these ancient Chinese poems.
